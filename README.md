Scripts

- I'm NOT a developer... These are things I cobbled together to help myself out. Error checking and sanity are not my style...
- Use at your own risk!

- dreambox_xmltvmap.py - This script will generate a channel mapping XML file from enigma2's lamed & mc2xml output.  The map can be used with epgimport for enigma2
- import_lamedb_names_icons.py - This script will copy channel names & icons from enigma2's lamedb and OpenPli's picon format and put them into MythTV
- mc2xml_mythtv.py - This script takes XML output from mc2xml and fills the xmltvid field in MythTV's database
